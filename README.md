For the first time worldwide, the whole-genome sequencing of a Chinese individual from telomere to telomere is completed and this work is published in a recent issue of Genomics, Proteomics and Bioinformatics. 
The cover art is designed by Yongning Zhu from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Drawing inspiration from the ancient portrait of Yao etched on pictorial stones millennia ago and modern electron microscope images of chromosomes, this artwork beautifully presents a fusion of the misterious archaeological relics with the illuminating discoveries brought forth by modern technology. The gentle glow filtering through the crevice hints at the promising future awaiting scientific genome-based discoveries. Envision a thousand years hence, when our descendants might stumble upon this very issue - would they, with the same empathy and gratitude, recognize and appreciate the dedication woven into the publication?

This work pioneers the [FLIP fluid simulation](https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/the-science-of-fluid-sims/) method used in softwares including Maya Bifrost and Houdini FLIP solver, and studio tools including SQUIRT from Double Negative Visual Effects. By combining the topological flexibility in particle simulation and spatial uniformity and efficiency in grid solver, fluid simulation is now affordable in real-time scenario. This technique is also used in movies including [Avatar](https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/the_tech_behind_the_tools_of_avatar_part_2_naiad/), [Battleship](https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/battleship-tactical-water-and-fluid-sims/), Alice in Wonderland, and games including Mass Effects 3 and now becomes one of the main fluid simulation frameworks.

Multigrid methods are wellknown as a fast solver for elasticity problems. However, for near-incompressible materials, required in the simulation of bulging and stretching effects in animation, the problem becomes ill-posed. We introduced a solution with continuation even to the extreme of animation exageration, and demonstrated its applicability to arbitrary articulated characters.

Destruction fragments are missing in the Finite Element simulation of earthquake destruction due to the element fracture and ill-conditioning. Rigid body dynamics are used to reconstruct and continue the simulation of broken fractures and recover the debris extention. 

Digital Humanity

<img src="img/shanghailib3.jpg" width = "600" />
Digital Humanities Platform in Shanghai library keeps nearly a million records about historical characters and events. These characters and events are marked by the researchers with their humanity values, classes, keywords, and relationships with other items. Our visualization builds up a hierarchical structure in the immersive virtual world to reveal the compacity, complexity and availability of this database.

For the first time worldwide, the whole-genome sequencing of a Chinese individual from telomere to telomere is completed and published in Genomics, Proteomics and Bioinformatics. 
The cover art is designed by Yongning Zhu from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. This artwork draws inspiration from both the timeless portrait of Yao captured on pictorial stones millennia ago and contemporary chromosome images from T2T-YAO, the newly discovered. The gentle glow filtering through the crevice hints at the bright future awaiting scientific genome-based discoveries. Envision a thousand years hence, when our descendants might stumble upon this very issue - would they, with the same empathy and gratitude, recognize and honor the dedication woven into the scientists efforts?
