Inquiry-based teaching is a methodology promoting the students‘ active learning, learning interest and performance. The students are immersed in a personalized virtual learning environment surrounded by knowledge cards arranged by the knowledge management system.

This work pioneers the [FLIP fluid simulation](https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/the-science-of-fluid-sims/) method used in softwares including Maya Bifrost and Houdini FLIP solver, and studio tools including SQUIRT from Double Negative Visual Effects. By combining the topological flexibility in particle simulation and spatial uniformity and efficiency in grid solver, fluid simulation is now affordable in real-time scenario. This technique is also used in movies including [Avatar](https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/the_tech_behind_the_tools_of_avatar_part_2_naiad/), [Battleship](https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/battleship-tactical-water-and-fluid-sims/), Alice in Wonderland, and games including Mass Effects 3 and now becomes one of the main fluid simulation frameworks.

Multigrid methods are wellknown as a fast solver for elasticity problems. However, for near-incompressible materials, required in the simulation of bulging and stretching effects in animation, the problem becomes ill-posed. We introduced a solution with continuation even to the extreme of animation exageration, and demonstrated its applicability to arbitrary articulated characters.

Water color pouring，silk embroidery, and abstract geometry, depict the impressions of the holy mother river. 
In the misty moonlight, by the colorful flowers, with shimmering ripples, appears the dreamy spring river.

Digital Humanities Platform in Shanghai library keeps nearly a million records about historical characters and events. These characters and events are marked by the researchers with their humanity values, classes, keywords, and relationships with other items. Our visualization builds up a hierarchical structure in the immersive virtual world to reveal the compacity, complexity and availability of this database.
