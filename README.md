Dialogue 2.0, 2021 (Coming soon....)

Water color pouring，silk embroidery, and abstract geometry, depict the impressions of the holy mother river. 
In the misty moonlight, by the colorful flowers, with shimmering ripples, appears the dreamy spring river.

Historical epic and traditional rhythm, music performance and immersive new media art, generative algorithm and artistic design
join to present our new media art Concert: Dialogue 2.0

In this work, we introduced FLIP method which becomes one of the main fluid simulation frameworks in computer animation and visual effects movies. By combining the topological flexibility in particle simulation and spatial uniformity and efficiency in grid solver, fluid simulation is now affordable in real-time scenario.

Multigrid methods are wellknown as a fast solver for elasticity problems. However, for near-incompressible materials, required in the simulation of bulging and stretching effects in animation, the problem becomes ill-posed. We introduced a solution with continuation even to the extreme of animation exageration, and demonstrated its applicability to arbitrary articulated characters.

Digital humanity
Digital Humanities Platform in Shanghai library keeps nearly a million records about historical characters and events. These characters and events are marked by the researchers with their humanity values, classes, keywords, and relationships with other items. Our visualization builds up a hierarchical structure in the immersive virtual world to reveal the compacity, complexity and availability of this database.
